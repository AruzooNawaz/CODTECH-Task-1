Objective:

The objective of the grade tracker project is to develop a Java application that allows users to manage and track student grades effectively. The program should enable users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and optionally compute the GPA based on the average grade. This application aims to provide a simple yet functional tool for students, teachers, or administrators to monitor academic performance.
Technology Used:

    Java Programming Language:
        Purpose: Java is chosen for its platform independence, object-oriented programming features, and robust standard libraries.
        Usage: Used to implement the core logic of the grade tracker application, including class definitions, methods for grade calculations, and handling user input/output.

    IDE (Integrated Development Environment):
        Purpose: Provides a development environment with features like code editing, debugging, and project management.
        Usage: IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans are typically used for developing and testing the Java application.

    Scanner Class:
        Purpose: A standard class in Java that provides methods for reading user input.
        Usage: Used in the application to capture user inputs for student names and grades entered via the console.
        
        Key Features:

    Input Handling: Uses Scanner for user input, allowing the user to enter grades interactively.
    Grade Calculation: Calculates the average grade based on the grades entered.
    GPA Calculation (Optional): Implements a basic GPA calculation based on the average grade, mapping ranges to GPA values (e.g., 4.0 for 90% and above).
